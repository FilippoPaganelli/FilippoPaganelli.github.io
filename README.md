### iOS app for hand gestures recognition

Me and a colleague at university coded an iOS app for recognising hand gestures (signes and numbers). 
The app uses two ML models for giving predictions ([- code here -](https://github.com/FilippoPaganelli/SistemiDigitaliM20-21/tree/main/Fabrizio-Paganelli/AVDepthCamera)). 

### Crossword playground project:

A very simple playground for trying my crosswords (only Italian by now). 
It's almost entirely in JavaScript ([- script here -](https://github.com/FilippoPaganelli/FilippoPaganelli.github.io/blob/master/js/cw-board.js)).
