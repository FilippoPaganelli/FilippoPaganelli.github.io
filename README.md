### Crossword playground project: [page here](https://filippopaganelli.github.io/crosswords.html)

This project is specific of this website, it's listed in [my projects](https://filippopaganelli.github.io/projects.html) page. 

It's a very simple playground for playing my crosswords (only Italian by now) 
and it's almost entirely in JavaScript ([script here](https://github.com/FilippoPaganelli/FilippoPaganelli.github.io/blob/master/js/cw-board.js)). 

In the future, I may be designing puzzles in English as well.
